/**
 * This class manages a thread pool of {@code flood workers} who are tasked with
 * sending multiple requests to the {@link ResourceFloodStability.Target} {@code
 * resource(s)}.
 * <p>
 * The results are then returned, ({@link Runnable} types do not have the ability
 * to return values), to the client object. After calling the method
 * {@link AbstractConcurrentResourceFloodStability#flood()}, the default behaviour
 * of class is to immediately {@code flood} the {@link ResourceFloodStability.Target}
 * without any concerns for timing or synchronization of the start process -- in
 * other words there is no "starter pistol". This may be sufficient for many tests,
 * but other strategies should be considered to increase the chances of thread
 * interleaving and race conditions.
 * <p>
 * Post-flood, all allocated resources associated with the
 * {@link FloodExecutorService} are destroyed. However, if the
 * {@link AbstractConcurrentResourceFloodStability#open()} method is called but the
 * {@code flood} is unused for whatever reason, it is highly recommend to call
 * the {@link AbstractConcurrentResourceFloodStability#close()} method to clean up.
