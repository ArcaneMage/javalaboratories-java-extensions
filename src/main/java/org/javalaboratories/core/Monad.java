/**
 * A {@code monad} is a structure that supports the function programming
 * {@code bind} operator through the {@code flatMap} operation.
 * <p>
 * This is important in that it is the only mechanism allowed in the world of
 * functional programming the ability to transform the {@code value} within the
 * {@code monad container}. {@code flatMap} can transform {@code functions} that
 * return {@code monad} containers. Using a functor's {@code map} instead on a
 * function returning a {@code monad}, causes the resultant transformation to be
 * a nested {@code monad}, which is not always desirable. In such scenarios, use
 * the {@code flatMap} instead to perform the transformation.
